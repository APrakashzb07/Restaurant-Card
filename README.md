<h1>Restaurant Card</h1>
<h4>My project, "Restaurant Card," is a dynamic web application that showcases various restaurants in real-time using a restaurant API. This project highlights both the fundamental and advanced uses of React.js, offering a seamless and interactive user experience.

At its core, the application fetches real-time data from a restaurant API, displaying a wide range of restaurants with their respective details like names, ratings, cuisines, and locations. Each restaurant is presented on an individual card, making the interface visually appealing and easy to navigate. Users can browse through the listings, view detailed information about each restaurant, and even filter their search based on specific criteria such as cuisine type or rating.

The project demonstrates essential React.js concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and props. Each restaurant card is a reusable component, showcasing how Reactâ€™s modular design can create a maintainable and scalable application. State management is handled efficiently to ensure smooth updates and data rendering as new information is fetched from the API.

Additionally, this project incorporates React Hooks to manage side effects and state, enhancing the overall performance and responsiveness of the application. The use of modern JavaScript (ES6+) features, such as async/await for handling asynchronous API calls, further exemplifies the practical implementation of React.js in a real-world scenario.

Overall, "Restaurant Card" is a testament to the versatility and power of React.js in building interactive, data-driven web applications.</h4>
